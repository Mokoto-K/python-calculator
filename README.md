# Python Calculator

<hr>

As the title suggests, this is a simple calculator build in python. After a long semesters of Data science and Java, 
I felt like I needed a quick re-primer on developing small programs in python, I decided on a calculator.

Hopefully more projects to come during my break

## Edit (10/10/24)
While fixing up some documentation on this project I realise that I haven't designed this very intelligently. I would 
like to improve upon this design in the not to distant future, but for now im going to work on some other things that 
interest me as this was just a project to remind me of program design after a few months of data sci.
